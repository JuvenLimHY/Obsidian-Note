Maximum Potential Points: 40

You have agreed with the client to perform an assumed breach scenario penetration test against their Microsoft Windows Active Directory infrastructure. You can use the credential below to have access to the WS26 client machine in oscp.exam domain.

Username: r.andrews
Password: BusyOfficeWorker890

The final objective of the Active Directory penetration test is to gain Domain Administrator level rights on the network. The Active Directory network can be located at the following IP addresses:


172.16.114.200
172.16.114.202
192.168.114.206

Main Objectives:

- Get Administrative interactive access to the WS26 client machine and obtain proof.txt file in a valid way, note that there is no local.txt file.
- Get Administrative interactive access to the SRV22 client machine and obtain proof.txt file in a valid way, note that there is no local.txt file.
- Get Administrative interactive access to the Domain Controller (DC20) and obtain the proof.txt file in a valid way, note that there is no local.txt file.
- Submit proof.txt files in the Control Panel.

Documentation Requirements:

- Document each step and command of your attack in a way that it can be replicated following a "copy/paste" approach
- Create screenshots showing various steps and stages of the attack performed
- Create a valid screenshot showing the content of proof.txt and the machine IP address
- Provide the link or the copy of the script/exploits being used
- Document any changes done to the original scripts or exploits being used
- Provide a summary and overview of the vulnerabilities found in performed attacks and exploitation processes. You must show all steps executed against the entire Active Directory domain used to obtain Domain Administrator privileges. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Reverting a single machine is not possible; reverting any AD set machine will revert the entire AD network. Please wait 5 minutes after reverting to ensure all services are operational. The full revert process may take 5-7 minutes.

Please note that not all machines will respond to ICMP/ping requests.

There are no dependencies between the Active Directory set and the stand alone machines.
